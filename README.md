# Application-of-Intra-ensemble-Network-on-Machine-Reading-Comprehension-MRC

Here is the capstone project for my undergraduate in the area of NLP.

• Ran six baseline models and inter-ensemble models (bagging, staking) in MRC as benchmarks; based on Bert, 
created a new ensemble method in MRC --- intra-ensemble method
• Created architecture of intra-ensemble model, an end-to-end model trained several sub-networks simultaneously 
within one neural network
